# Awesome Chocolates Commercial Analysis: Targeting Profitability in Key Markets

## 1. Project Background

Awesome Chocolates, a global confectionery company, requires a comprehensive commercial performance review to drive profitability and benchmark sales team efficiency. The primary challenge is the severe disparity in **Profit LBS% (Profitability Percentage)** across global regions, particularly the low performance in the India market.

This project delivers a deep-dive into sales, cost, and profit data to inform decisions on product line pruning, sales team incentive structures, and crucial market restructuring.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
* **Regional Profitability Crisis:** Evaluation of the critical low-margin performance in the India market.
* **Product Line Pruning:** Identification of low-LBS% products globally and within problem markets.
* **Sales Team Benchmarking:** Comparison of Sales vs. Profit generated by individual team members.

* **Analysis Code:** The data transformation steps used in Power Query and DAX can be found [here](LINK_TO_CODE_FILE).

## 2. Data Structure & Initial Checks

### 📊 Data Overview
The analysis was built on a sophisticated **Star Schema** data model designed to handle complex relationships between sales, products, people, and time. The model was constructed from **five separate files** (Shipments, Products, Locations, People, and Calendar), ensuring data integrity and flexibility.

The core relationship links the central **`shipments` (Fact Table)** to four **Dimension Tables** (`products`, `locations`, `calendar`, and `people`).

### 🔗 Data Model (Star Schema)
The structure allows for highly detailed analysis, such as filtering sales by a specific salesperson, region, and date simultaneously.

### 🧹 Data Cleaning and Preparation
The data cleaning and transformation process was entirely executed using **Power Query (M Language)** to ensure data quality and integrity before modeling.

* **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load):** Power Query was used to merge and shape the five independent files into the Star Schema.
* **Aggregation (Pivot Tables/DAX):** Measures like **Total Sales**, **Total Profit**, **Total Cost**, and the crucial **Profitability % (LBS%)** were calculated in Power BI using DAX and supporting Pivot Tables.
* **Advanced Features:** Prepared the data structure to enable **Field Parameters** for the time-series chart and **Visual Navigation** for the Salesperson/Product switch.

## 3. Executive Summary

Awesome Chocolates generated **$34M in total sales** and **$21M in profit**, but performance varies dramatically by region. The **India market** exhibits critical issues, including a near-stagnant **2.8% MOM growth** and an extremely low **3.8% Profit LBS%**. This indicates severe cost-to-sale inefficiencies in that market. The strategic focus must immediately shift to diagnosing the India market's cost drivers and pruning low-margin products globally.

### Overview of Commercial Health and Trends

* **Regional Profitability Crisis:** The analysis of the India market reveals a low **3.8% Profit LBS%**, confirming that products and sales strategies are fundamentally flawed in that region and require immediate restructuring.
* **Monthly Volatility:** The overall trend line shows high sales volatility, with the company-wide decline of **10.8% MOM** suggesting systemic instability in the commercial pipeline.

### Product Profitability Deep Dive (India Market Focus)

This section details which products are driving and which are dragging down the profitability **specifically in the India market**.

* **India's Margin Risks:** In the India market, products like **Milk Bars ($99K profit)** and **Raspberry Choco ($114K profit)** are major contributors to low overall LBS%. Their high sales volume but low profitability are the root cause of the regional margin dilution.
* **Global Margin Risks:** Globally, products like **50% Dark Bites (27.2% LBS%)** remain a margin risk across all regions.

### Sales Team and Regional Benchmarking

* **Top Performers:** Globally, **Gunnar Cockshoot** and **Dennison Crosswaite** lead the team with the highest profitability margins (Profit LBS%).
* **Regional Disparity:** The massive difference in LBS% between Canada (7.2%) and India (3.8%) confirms that sales execution or operational costs differ significantly by geography, requiring country-specific action plans.

## 4. Business Recommendations

Based on the detailed commercial performance analysis, the following actions are critical to stabilize sales, reduce cost-to-sale ratios, and maximize profitability (Profit LBS%):

* **1. Emergency Review of India Market:** Launch an immediate investigation into the high operational costs or severe discounting contributing to the **3.8% Profit LBS% in India**. Strategic intervention, potentially including restructuring local contracts or logistics, is required.
* **2. Global Product Line Pruning:** Strategically review the low-margin products, specifically **50% Dark Bites** and **Milk Bars**. The recommendation is to either **reformulate** the cost structure or **discontinue** these products to immediately boost the overall company profitability percentage.
* **3. Optimize Shipment Logistics:** Address the high volume of **small shipments** (as shown in the Shipment Analysis). Implement minimum order quantities or use aggregated freight options to reduce logistical costs.
* **4. Leverage Top Sales Performers:** Analyze the sales strategies of high-LBS% earners like **Gunnar Cockshoot**. Formalize their methods and implement mandatory training for the entire sales force.
* **5. Strategic Product Focus in India:** Shift the product focus in India away from low-margin items like **Milk Bars** and **Raspberry Choco** toward products with proven global LBS% success.
